# Ultrsonic-Range-Sensor
I made a small project with Hands on study of Arduino micro controller architecture and implemented design of ultrasonic range sensor on Arduino training kit. I also implemented a program on Matlab to acquire serial data from the micro controller for plotting and analysis.
The procedure is pretty simple just open the RADAR.ino file to get the ardunio code and RADAR.m to get the matlab code for plotting of the data.
There is also a RADAR.pdf file that can be refered for the connection details and detailed explanation.
